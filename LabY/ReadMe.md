# What we did:
* Created file **semaphore.cpp** and **Makefile**

* We created a semaphore program that simulates the Smokers Dilemma, with agents, and pushers.

---

# How to verify the project works

Run the following commands in order:

* Open up a terminal
* Navigate to the directory which contains the `LabY` folder
* Type the following commands into your terminal

```
cd LabY/
make
./sema4
```

* At this point you should see the debug messages for the semaphore. Each message is printed before the semaphore calls are made and are used to verify that it is working.
* We are using a .cpp file due to issues with bochs over ssh

---

This concludes everything that you need to do to run the project and confirm that it is working correctly
