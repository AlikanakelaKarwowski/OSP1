# What we did:
* Created file **Shell.cpp**

* Created Shell command functions **boot**, **clrs**, **echo**, **copy**, **ddir**, **exec**, **help**, **prnt**, **remv**, **senv**, **show**, **twet**, and **exit()**


---

# How to verify the project works

Run the following commands in order:

* Open terminal
* Navigate to the directory which contains the `Lab5` folder
* Type the following commands into your terminal

```
cd Lab5/
make all
./Shell
```

* At this point you should see the Shell program running. And any of the commands above are recognized by the Shell.
* I am using make files and a cpp file because kernal.c doesn't work with the amount of commands saved which made the files too large.
* Professor Oneil has told me to use a cpp file instead.

* Once you are finished Type the following command to exit the shell

```
exit
```

This concludes everything that you need to do to run the project and confirm that it is working correctly
